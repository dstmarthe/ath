Kratos, the main character of the "God of War" video game series, is one of the most iconic and recognizable figures in gaming history. With his imposing build, ferocious fighting style, and ghostly white skin, he has captured the imaginations of gamers around the world. But what is it that makes Kratos' skin white, and why is it such an integral part of his character design?

Kratos was originally a general in the Spartan army, and he was at war with the barbarians. When he and his men were losing the battle, he called upon Ares, the God of War, to destroy all of his remaining enemies. In return, Kratos promised to serve Ares and grant his every wish.

Ares then ordered Kratos to attack Sparta, his own home. However, Kratos was blinded by a spell cast by Athena, and in his confusion, he accidentally slaughtered his wife and daughter. Their ashes became attached to Kratos' skin as a reminder of his tragic mistake, and he was consumed by grief and guilt.

This event serves as a catalyst for Kratos' quest for vengeance against the gods, including Ares himself. As a demi-god, Kratos is not entirely human, and his unusual skin tone reflects this fact. Additionally, the ashes of his family are a recurring theme throughout the series, and they serve as a reminder of Kratos' tragic past and his ongoing struggle to come to terms with his actions.

Kratos' appearance has evolved over the course of the series, but his white skin remains a constant reminder of his connection to the gods and his tragic past. In the more recent games, his skin has a slightly warmer, more human tone, which could be seen as a reflection of his character growth and his evolving relationship with his family and the gods.

In conclusion, Kratos' distinctive appearance and white skin are an essential part of his character design and have helped to make him one of the most beloved and enduring figures in gaming history. His tragic backstory and ongoing struggle to cope with his past serve as a driving force for his actions and motivations throughout the series.
