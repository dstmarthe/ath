### The History of the Rule

The origin of the "No White After Labor Day" rule dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During this time, the American elite would spend their summers in vacation homes, often by the shore, where they would wear light, airy clothing in white to stay cool in the hot weather.

However, when Labor Day arrived and the summer season was officially over, these wealthy Americans would return to the city and switch to darker, more formal attire for the cooler months. As a result, white clothing became associated with summer and was considered inappropriate for autumn and winter.

The Persistence of the Rule

Despite the fact that the rule was originally intended for a small group of wealthy Americans, it has since become a widespread fashion rule that is still followed by many people today. While some see the rule as outdated and irrelevant, others view it as a way to stay stylish and in line with traditional fashion norms.
