Prepare yourself to be amazed, folks! The Seven Wonders of the World are the ultimate proof that humans are capable of creating jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring landmarks that will leave you scratching your head and wondering: "How the heck did they do that?!"

Let's take a look at the world's most stunning achievements.



## The Great Pyramid of Giza

Let's start with the Great Pyramid of Giza, shall we? This baby is the only wonder that's still standing today, and it's been around for over 4,500 years! That's older than your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandma! (So great)

Pharaoh Khufu, the dude who commissioned the pyramid, wanted to make sure he had a sweet pad to rest in after he kicked the bucket. So he built a tomb that's made up of over 2 million stone blocks and is taller than the Statue of Liberty! Talk about a high-rise condo!

## The Hanging Gardens of Babylon

Now, let's move on to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. According to legend, King Nebuchadnezzar II built this garden for his wife, who was homesick for her lush homeland. Aw, how sweet!

But this wasn't just any old garden. The Hanging Gardens were built on a series of terraces, and water was pumped from the Euphrates River to keep the plants hydrated. It's like a real-life version of the hanging gardens of your dreams!

## The Statue of Zeus at Olympia

Next up, we've got the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. This bad boy was one of the greatest works of art in the ancient world, and it depicted Zeus, the king of the gods, sitting on his throne like a boss.

The statue was made of ivory and gold, and it stood in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. I bet it was the hottest tourist attraction of its time!

## The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus

Now, let's take a look at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. This temple was dedicated to the goddess Artemis, and it was one of the most beautiful structures of the ancient world.

It was built in several stages, with the latest version made of marble and featuring 127 columns. That's more columns than the number of times your mom has told you to clean your room!

We know still haven’t done it so, we’ll help your mom and tell you one more time to clean your room!

The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was built for King Mausolus of Caria and his queen, Artemisia. It was a stunning structure that featured intricate carvings and sculptures, and it was a fitting tribute to the king and queen.

But the Mausoleum wasn't just a pretty face. It was also a tomb, which means that it was the final resting place for the king and queen. Talk about a stylish way to go out!

## The Colossus of Rhodes

The Colossus of Rhodes was a bronze statue that was built to honor the sun god, Helios. It stood at a whopping 33 meters tall, making it one of the largest bronze statues ever made.

But unfortunately, the Colossus didn't have the best luck. It was destroyed by an earthquake just a few decades after it was built. Bummer!

## The Lighthouse of Alexandria

Last but not least, we have the Lighthouse of Alexandria. This lighthouse stood at the entrance to the harbor of Alexandria, Egypt, and it was considered one of the tallest structures in the ancient world.

It was built with a fire at the top, which acted as a beacon for ships approaching the harbor. Imagine being lost at sea, and suddenly seeing the light from the Lighthouse of Alexandria. You'd probably scream: "Hallelujah!"
