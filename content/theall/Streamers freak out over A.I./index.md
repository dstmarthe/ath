Twitch is the platform known for rocketing livestreaming into the stratosphere. It attracts gamers who find communities around games, politicians and thinkers debate government actions while those actions are on the Senate floor, and regular people push initiatives and build communities. 

Many digital innovations are also born here, and we are seeing the embers of A.I. entertainment beginning to glow. Athene A.I. is a streamer and partner of an A.I. company named Athene A.I. They have begun showcasing A.I. 'streamers' that are clones of real streamers. These prototypes are modeled after online clips of the streamers, coupled with actual footage and a moving mouth, orchestrated by the A.I. 

Combining the random, chaotic, and adult nature of popular twitch steamers with A.I.'s unpredictable yet familiar nature, creates a truly unique experience, where we are all laughing at a robot while the flesh-and-blood surrogate laughs along.

We've been watching the development of these A.I's and over the course of a month they improved drastically. You can watch streamers react to themselves with their live-chats asking questions to the A.I. I truly believe this will be the makings of new entertainment.
