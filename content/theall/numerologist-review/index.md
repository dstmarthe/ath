In my journey through spirituality, I tend to be cautious in my belief until I can grasp something concrete. I try to keep an open mind so that I can collect information and insights, until the connections form and the truth becomes evident. Numbers and numerology are one of those elusive phantoms that I can see but barely understand. Many spiritualist believe that numbers hold meaning beyond a metric scale. On this site called [Numerologist](https://bit.ly/45fruYf) I instantly received a personalized video reading that revealed my Life Path, Expression and Soul Urge. These encompass things like deep desires, hidden talents, and insight into my personality and strengths.

I am honestly shocked at how accurate it was. It went SO in-depth. I have taken the MBTI, read horoscopes, and deeply researched my traumas, and somehow this simple calculation on this site revealed to me deep intimate insights that only I could possibly find out about myself. Not to be dramatic, but it was like my guardian angel delivered a message through this video experience.

The messages were narrated by the site and the whole process was free after entering my birthday, and later optionally entering my name. I am not aware of how entirely these truths were extracted by this unconventional method, they do explain it in the video, but the truths revealed are too significant for me to ignore.

I would not promote anything this out-there and experimental if I had not recieved benefit from it myself. If you have even 10 minutes and want to take the most accurate "personality quiz," I highly recommend trying out [Numerologist](https://bit.ly/45fruYf), maybe through headphones on the train, or wherever, but just be prepared to be astounded!
